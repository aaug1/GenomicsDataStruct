## Motivation

So we just saw how bloom filters worked, so what are cuckoo filters, and how does it improve upon a bloom filter?

Similar to bloom filters, **cuckoo filters** are a *probabilistic data structure* that, in response to a search or query of a key, will return either


Just like hash tables, this occurs in approximately/amortized O(1) lookup time. Sometimes we need to delete an item from our data structure. Bloom filters
risk removing multiple items if some of the indices revert back to 0 because some indices being 1 can have overlap with multiple items. With Cuckoo Filters,
the fingerprint

## Pros
1. Uses constant space
2. No false negatives! You can be sure of a "no" if it returns "no"
3. Can never fail to add an element
4. Actual elements are not stored (ensures privacy of data)
5. Can modify settings to suit your needs!

## Cons
1. Cannot remove items from bloom filters.
2. Uncertainty in true positives
